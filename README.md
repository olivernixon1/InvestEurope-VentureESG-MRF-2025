# InvestEurope VentureESG MRF 2025 Validator

The InvestEurope VentureESG MRF 2025 Validator is an open-source Python3 program utilising the Cerberus library to validate .csv files according to the machine-readable format of the 2025 Invest Europe framework.

# Installation of web-app

Download the source code of the project to a single folder.

If you do not have Python 3 installed, go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and install Python 3.13.

The validator requires two dependencies to be installed. Open a terminal window and run:

```
pip3 install flask
```
Then run: 
```
pip3 install cerberus
```
You can now run the project. In the terminal window, type:
```
python3 [file path of your Invest Europe VentureESG Validator.py file]
```
And hit enter.

Go to your browser and enter http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in the URL bar. The validator should be running locally there.
